              What Can I Do?

            </h1>
            <p>
              There are plenty of opportunities that an individual can take to reduce
              the problems with industrial animal farming.
            </p>
            <h2>
              <b>
              Eat less meat
              </b>
            </h2>
            <p>
              This is by far the best option that you can do to reduce health risks.
              If you avoid eating meat, then meat factories will have to produce
              less. This will result in a healthier atmosphere and reduce the
              risk of human transmitted diseases from animals. In addition, eating
              less meat will directly impact you because it will reduce your chances
              at getting infected  by foodborne illnesses such as salmonella.
            </p>
            <p>
              If possible, it would be best to go vegetarian or vegan. However,
              this is not entirely necessary as many people are simply just choosing
              consciously reduce their meat intake. Some celebrities that are choosing
              to follow this trend are Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron.
            </p>
            <h2>
              <b>
              Avoid industrially farmed meat
              </b>
            </h2>
            <p>
              This is also a fairly obvious option. Most of the problems that this
              website lists stem as a result of industrial farming practices.
              Methods such as scalding chickens' feathers off and cramming pigs
              into tight pens all increase the risk of infections spreading.
              Don't support companies who abide by these practices. Rather,
              buy meat from companies that practice free range, organic farming.
            </p>
            <h2>
              <b>
              Continue educating yourself

            </h2>
            <p>
              The more you learn about meat, the more you will know when it comes
              to deciding your eating habits. Below are some of my favorite sources
              (which I also used during the making of this website)

            <h2>
              <b>

            </h2>
            <p>
              It is also highly beneficial to join an organization. While groups                like <a href="http://www.farmusa.org/"> FARM </a> focus primarily
              on animal rights, they still are very influential when it comes
              to lobbying against industrial animal farming.
