Concerned Carnivore is a hub for informing young people about the health effects of factory farming.

This is a website that puts together weeks of research that I did for my college general education writing class.

Find the website at http://concernedcarnivore.com.

I was unable to make it fully responsive before my deadline. Therefore, the website might look different on mobile.
